# PSNWS

This is a PowerShell module to get data from the National Weather Service

## Installation

Currently the best way to do this is to just copy all the repo files into your modules directory

Powershell 6+
```C:\Program Files\Powershell\Modules\PSNWS\```

Windows Powershell
```C:\Program Files\WindowsPowershell\Modules\PSNWS\```


## Usage

Currently the only command that really works is Get-NWSForecast.  This will return a detailed forecast.
